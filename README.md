# Tech Evolution

**Tech Evolution** is a puzzle game around the development of electronic devices and how they are made.


# How To Play:

 - Left Click to select item
 - Left Click (when you are holding a node) to merge with the node you are hovering over.

## Why I Created Tech Evolution

I created the demo of **Tech Evolution** by creating a very simple unity project with only 3 nodes. I started to like the game and slowly over the summer created the game. 

## Development Process

I created this project in Unity using C#.

 - During the first week I created a simple demo to make sure I wanted to go ahead with the game.
 - During the second week I implemented simple textures and created scripts that I could use again and again to make the game easy to scale up.
 - During the third week I created the parallax scrolling background to get the game feeling and looking nicer, I also added this effect to the clouds too. I also implemented a barebones achievement system.
 - During the fourth week I worked on the node artwork and finishing the achevement system. 
 
 ## Future Plans
 I'm planning to:
 
 - Add more node to extend the gameplay
 - Add a menu system
 - Fix a bug where you can pick up multiple nodes 
 - Add music
 - Finish converting old achievements to new node artwork
